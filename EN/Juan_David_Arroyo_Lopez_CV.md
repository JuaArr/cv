# Summary

Final-year Civil Engineering student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, with over 2 years of experience in geotechnical research focused on physical-mechanical characterization of soils and mathematical modeling. As a former DAAD scholar (cohort 24/25), I completed a year-long exchange at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany. I have proficiency in infrastructure design software, geographic information systems (GIS), and programming languages. I stand out for my commitment, responsibility, and high adaptability, key skills I have demonstrated in national and international research and extension projects.
